Implementation of  the paper: "A compact deep architecture for real-time saliency prediction".

paper URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.image.2022.116671

# Folder includes:
1- The ".ipynb" file: the implementation of the FSM3 model.

2- The ".h" file: the weights of the trained model.


- The project codes were rewritten to be used in google Colab.
- Copy the files in your google drive in "Colab Notbooks" folder. 
- To apply the model to your images, you should copy your images in the folder specified by "input_imgs_path".
